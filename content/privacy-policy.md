## Information we collect

- Information you provide directly: when you contact us, subscribe to updates, or otherwise communicate with us (for example: name, email address, and any other information you choose to provide).
- Automatically collected information: technical and usage data collected automatically when you visit the Site, such as IP address, browser and device type, pages viewed, time spent on pages, and referring sites.
- Cookies and similar technologies: we (and third parties we use) may place cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies on your device to recognize your preferences and collect analytics data.

## Use of third‑party tracking and analytics

We use third‑party services (for example, analytics and performance providers) that may collect information about your interaction with the Site to help us improve performance, content, and user experience. These third‑party services may set their own cookies, use pixel tags, and/or collect device identifiers and usage information.

Examples of purposes for third‑party tracking:
- Analytics and site performance monitoring
- Error reporting and debugging

Third parties operate under their own privacy and data processing policies — we encourage you to review those policies if you want details about how those services collect and use data.

Most browsers allow you to control cookie settings (including blocking or deleting cookies) through the browser preferences. If you disable cookies, some features of the Site may not function correctly.

## Data sharing and disclosure

We may share information with:
- Service providers and vendors who perform services on our behalf (for example hosting, analytics, and email delivery).
- Law enforcement, regulators, or other third parties when required by law or to protect rights, property, or safety.

We do not sell personal information.

## Data retention and security

We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.
