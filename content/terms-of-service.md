# Terms of Service

Effective date: 2025-10-26

Welcome to Workspices. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Workspices software-as-a-service offering (the "Service" or "Workspices"), provided by the operator of this site ("we", "us", or "Company"). By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Accounts and registration

- Eligibility: You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and able to form a binding contract to use the Service.
- Account information: When creating an account you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to keep it updated. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
- Authorized users: Accounts may allow multiple authorized users depending on your subscription plan; you are responsible for each authorized user's compliance with these Terms.

## 2. Subscriptions, fees and payment

- Subscription plans: The Service is offered on a subscription basis. The features available to you depend on the plan you select.
- Billing and payment: Subscription fees, billing frequency, and payment methods are described on our site and in your order. By subscribing you authorize us to charge your payment method for all recurring fees and any applicable taxes.
- Trials and promotions: If you participate in a free trial or promotion, additional terms may apply. We may require a payment method to activate a trial.
- Cancellations and refunds: You may cancel your subscription through your account or according to the procedure described on our site. Unless otherwise stated, subscription fees are non-refundable. We may offer refunds in our discretion where required by law.

## 3. Use of the Service and acceptable use

- License: Subject to these Terms and your payment of applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Service for your internal business purposes.
- Acceptable use: You agree not to use the Service to (a) violate laws or infringe others' rights, (b) distribute malware, spam, or other harmful content, (c) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, or (d) interfere with the operation of the Service. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate acceptable use policies.

## 4. User content and data

- Ownership: You retain ownership of the data and content you upload or submit to the Service ("Customer Data").
- License to operate: You grant us a limited license to store, copy, transmit, and display Customer Data solely as reasonably necessary to provide the Service and perform backups and maintenance.
- Responsibility: You are responsible for the accuracy, legality, and content of Customer Data and for obtaining any necessary rights and consents.
- Backups and export: We may provide tools for exporting your data. It is your responsibility to maintain backups; we are not liable for data loss except as required by law or these Terms.

## 5. Third‑party services and tracking

The Service may integrate with or use third‑party services (for example, payment processors, analytics, and hosting providers). Those third parties may collect and process data in accordance with their own terms and policies. Use of third‑party services is at your own risk. Our Privacy Policy describes how we handle analytics and tracking.

## 6. Intellectual property

- Our rights: Except for Customer Data, the Service and all intellectual property rights in the Service (including code, designs, documentation, and trademarks) are owned by the Company or its licensors.
- Feedback: If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant us an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and incorporate that feedback without obligation to you.

## 7. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to keep confidential any non-public information disclosed by the other party that is designated as confidential or reasonably should be understood to be confidential.

## 8. Termination

- Termination by you: You may terminate your subscription at any time by following the account cancellation process.
- Termination by us: We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms or for other reasons, including non-payment or suspected abuse. We will notify you when feasible.
- Effects of termination: Upon termination, we may disable your access and delete Customer Data after a retention period described in our policies. We may retain data as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

## 9. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your use of the Service, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third‑party rights.

## 12. Governing law and disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated, without regard to conflict of law rules. You and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction. (Replace with the specific governing law and forum applicable to your business.)

## 13. Changes to the Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (for example, via email or a prominent notice on the Service) before the changes take effect. Continued use after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

## 14. Miscellaneous

- Entire agreement: These Terms, together with any order forms and our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Service.
- Severability: If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
